The code sample is an extension to Sonar. This plugin performs static analysis of CSS file and provides the following:
* Number of lines
* Number of commented lines
* Number of violations (the rules are based common selector optimizations)

This code was created to ensure code quality.

I'm proud of this code because it extensible and can catch potentially bad design early on.
